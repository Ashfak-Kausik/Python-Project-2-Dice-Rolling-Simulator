# Python-Project-2-Dice-Rolling-Simulator
Simulating the rolling of a dice to generate random outcomes. The objectives are: Objectives:  Create a program that simulates rolling a dice and prints the result, and allow users to roll the dice multiple times.

Design and Approach:
Use the random.randint() function to generate numbers between 1 and 6, simulating a dice roll. Create a loop that allows the user to roll the dice as many times as they want.

Code Overview:
The program uses a while loop to continuously roll the dice until the user decides to stop. The roll_dice() function generates a random number between 1 and 6.

Key Features/Learned Concepts:
1. Random module for generating random numbers
2. Loops for repeated actions
3. User input to control the flow of the program
